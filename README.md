# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-Using-ML

The project "Calories Burned Prediction using Machine Learning" aims to develop a model that can estimate the number of calories a person burns during physical activities using machine learning techniques. The objective is to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate calorie expenditure based on various input parameters.

Here's a summary of the project steps and components:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset that includes information about different physical activities and the corresponding calorie burn values. This data can be obtained from sources such as fitness trackers, exercise machines, or scientific studies.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and suitability for training a machine learning model. This step involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a suitable format.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features or input variables that can accurately predict calorie burn. These features may include activity type, duration, heart rate, age, weight, and other relevant factors. Feature selection techniques help in choosing the most informative and significant variables.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the prediction task. Commonly used algorithms for regression tasks, such as predicting calorie burn, include XGboost regressor, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. The choice of algorithm depends on factors like dataset size, complexity, and desired accuracy.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Use the training set to train the machine learning model on the selected algorithm. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (calorie burn) during this phase. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize prediction errors.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing set. Metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE) can be used to assess the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
